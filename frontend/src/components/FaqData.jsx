        question: "Do I own my website?",
        answer: "Yes. You own your frontend code (the website part), content, data, and domain. There are a few different ways the code can be transferred to you, and we'll use the one you would like.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I don’t know how to update code?",
        answer: "You don’t need to. Your site is built to be stable and easily configurable. When your code is delivered we will walk you through how to make changes on your own, or we can make the changes for you.",
    },
    {
        question: "Where is my site hosted?",
        answer: "That depends on your setup. You can host it on a modern platform or with help through a managed setup. We'll recommend the best option based on your project or you can host it on our cloud infrastructure.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I make changes after launch?",
        answer: "Yes. You can request updates at any time. If you have a technical team, they can work with the code directly.",
    },
    {
        question: "What’s included with a starter site?",
        answer: "A professional business single page application, designed to reflect your branding.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after launch?",
        answer: "You get the final build, any login access you need, and clear instructions. You can manage hosting on your own, or we can help with that too.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you handle branding or logo design?",
        answer: "Branding and logo design aren’t handled in-house, but we have trusted partners and resources available. If you need help with visuals, let us know. We can coordinate it for you and keep the process simple.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take to launch a site?",
        answer: "Most sites are ready within 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the scope and how quickly you provide content. If you need something faster, just ask.",
    },
    {
        question: "What do you need from me to get started?",
        answer: "At minimum, we’ll need your logo (if you have one), the content for each page, and your preferred contact details. If you have colors, photos, or any other branding assets, send those too.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need more pages later?",
        answer: "That’s no problem. Your site is built to grow. You can add pages, features, or integrations whenever you're ready.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer refunds?",
        answer: "Unfortunately no, there are no refunds.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need a form for my customers to complete?",
        answer: "We can build that too. We'll get the specifics from you and make it happen.",
    },
    {
        question: "Still have questions?",
        answer: "Send a message to questions@deftvision.com or drop your question in the form below. I’ll get back to you soon.",
    },
